            <div id="column1" style="background-color: #001f3f">
                <p>At a glance, baseball can seem like an extremely complicated game with rules that are notoriously difficult to learn and understand for first-time viewers. But at the core of the game, baseball is a battle between pitcher and batter. Each at-bat is a faceoff between batters and pitchers: batters try to get on base, and pitchers try to get them out. This faceoff is the basis of all baseball games from its early history as a schoolyard game in New York during the early 19th century to the modern-day spectacles we see today like a battle between the Boston Red Sox and the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 2018 World Series. </p>
                <p>Major League Baseball as we know it today is quite different than its humble beginnings. Rules and strategies had not yet fully been developed by teams, and seemingly brutish practices such as throwing a caught ball at a baserunner or spitting on the ball before delivering a pitch were still considered legal. However, over nearly 150 years of organized, professional baseball, the rules and customs of America's game have evolved and adapted into the game we know today.
                </p>
                <p>But behind all these rule changes is still the battle between hitter and pitcher. The mark of a good hitter is his ability to get onbase consistently and the mark of a good pitcher is being able to get batters out consistently. Pitchers tend to have a slight advantage over batters historically with the average OBP for all players in every year at-bat recorded in Lahman's Baseball Database is XXXXXXXXXXX However, the beauty of baseball is that it has changed so much over the last 150 years as the Major League Baseball has grown and adapted to new rules. And we can see how these changes have impacted the success of hitters and pitchers against one another.
                </p>
                <p>While there are countless changes to the way the game has been played, the rules behind the game, and the culture and practices of players within the game of baseball, we want to point out three main changes to the game of baseball and how they have impacted the duel between batter and pitcher. These three changes are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The physical makeup of the baseball</li>
                  <li>The changing definition of the strike zone</li>
                  <li>The widespread use and subsequent ban of steroids within baseball</li>

                <p>These three changes to the game of baseball have had a tremendous impact on the battle between pitcher and batter and they are reflected statistically in the history of the game. We would like to spend some time to explain each of these changes in detail and show you how these changes impacted the success of pitchers or hitters against one another.

        <h1 class="panel"> Factor 1: Physical Make of the Ball </h1>
            <div id="column1" style="background-color: #003f5c">
                <p>Major League Baseball has not always been the highly-funded and professionally made product that it is today. In the early 20th century, baseballs were made with solid rubber cores and the threads and strings that make up the stitching of the ball were hand wound by factory workers. This resulted in a so-called "soft" or "dead" ball that compared to modern baseballs did not travel as far when struck by the bat. In 1920, Major League Baseball decided to standardize the process used to make baseballs. They replaced the rubber core with a modern cork core wrapped in a thin layer of rubber. The factories that made baseballs also became more industrial and were able wind the threads by machines. These changes made the ball to be much more tightly wound and hard and also made the balls much more uniformly made. </p>
                <p>With these new modifications to the ball, Major League Baseball entered the Live-Ball-Era and hitters were able to drive the ball much further than they had before. The result of these changes was a dramatic increase in the amount of homeruns hit and runs scored during baseball games. The changing of the ball led to a much more explosive offense and batters gaining an edge against pitchers that they never had not had in years past. As further proof of the impact of the physical makeup of the ball, we can look to the rubber shortage during WWII in the United States. Without crude rubber, baseball manufacturers were forced to replace the rubber wrappings in baseball with the less-bouncy balata which caused a dip in the batting power of hitters during the early 1940's.

        <h1 class="panel"> Factor 2: Changing the Strike Zone </h1>
            <div id="column1" style="background-color: #2f4b7c">
                <p>Traditionally in baseball, the strike zone (the area in which a pitcher needs to throw the ball in order for a strike to be called) is defined as an area over home plate extending from the armpits to the knees of a batter when in the batting position. Pitchers that have great control over their pitchers are more likely to be able to throw strikes when needed and therefore strike batters out. This relatively small area is very difficult to throw into consistently as the margin of error is razor-thin for pitchers. </p>
                <p>However, this strike zone size was changed for a brief period of time in the 1960's and the result were years of dominating pitching which have yet to be seen again in baseball. After years of scoring increases and more and more homeruns being hit, MLB team owners elected to change the definition of the strike zone from the standard armpits to knees, to an enlarged area of top of the batter's shoulder to the bottom of the batters knees. Pitchers were now able to make more mistakes in their pitches while still throwing strikes, and pitchers will great control were able to aim pitches much more effectively. The result of these changes were immediately evident with instant changes to statistics relating pitchers. The number of walks that teams threw per game plummeted compared to years past while the number of strikeouts that teams threw increased dramatically. Overall scoring decreased dramatically; these changes culminated in 1968, also known as "The Year of the Pitcher", in which dominating pitchers like Bob Gibson and Denny McLain overwhelmed hitters while on the mound. The league saw the lowest numbers for batting average and runs scored in decades, and fans starting to become disinterested in the game. Owners quickly elected to change back to the old strike zone, and statistics began to normalize to historical averages once again.
